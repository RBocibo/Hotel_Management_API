# Hotel_Management_API

- I created Hotel Management API using Onion architecture with separation of concern. 
- Making use of CQRS and mediater pattern.
- Making use of Repository pattern and Unit of Work.
- For Databases I used Entity Framework Core Code First.

##Requirements of the project:

- As a user I want to be able to search for available hotel rooms using the room ID or the room type.
- As a user I want to be able to book a room and add number of days booked for.
- As a user I want to be able to pay for the reservation I made.
- Customers can search hotels based on Room Category (examples. Radisson (VIP) Suit, President Suit
(Luxury)).
